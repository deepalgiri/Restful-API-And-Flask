        "   *   To get a list of users, a GET request might look like this:\n",

        "* **Key Roles of Flask-SQLAlchemy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. ORM Integration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* It integrates SQLAlchemy's ORM with Flask. The ORM allows you to interact with databases in an object-oriented way rather than writing raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can define your database tables as Python classes (called models), and SQLAlchemy will handle the conversion between your Python objects and database tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Simplified Database Management:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flask-SQLAlchemy automatically sets up a database session for each request, so you don’t have to manually handle connections and sessions. This means Flask can handle database operations (like queries, inserts, updates, and deletes) within the context of each web request.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Database Schema Definition:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* You define your database schema (tables, relationships, etc.) directly as Python classes. These models can include fields, types, and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Querying:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can use SQLAlchemy’s powerful querying capabilities to interact with your database using Python syntax, which is much cleaner and easier than raw SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: User.query.filter_by(name='John').all() instead of writing raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Automatic Table Creation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flask-SQLAlchemy can automatically create and manage the database tables based on your model definitions. It can also be configured to migrate the schema when you change your models using Flask-Migrate (which builds on Alembic).\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Database Session Management:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* It provides a session object to handle transactions. Each time a request is processed, Flask-SQLAlchemy ensures that a session is open, and any database interaction is handled properly within that session.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Database Configuration:**\n",
        "\n",
